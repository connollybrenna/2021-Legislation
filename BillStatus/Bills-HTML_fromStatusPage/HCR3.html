Therefore, the legislature finds that it is wrongful for the judiciary, either directly or indirectly, to define educational adequacy, to determine the cost of educational adequacy, to specify how to fund educational adequacy, or to provide accountability.  (See, e.g., </span><span class="csE3E0FE0B">Coleman v.

(See, </span><span class="csE3E0FE0B">Fogg v. Board of Education</span><span class="csDD5E5F52">, “It is a duty not imposed by constitutional provision, but has always been assumed by the state.”); and</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">	Whereas, had the framers intended to make an adequate education a constitutional right, they could have and would have said so in the same way that they enumerated various rights in Part 1 of our constitution, the Bill of Rights, by expressly calling it a right in that portion of our constitution; they would not have hidden a constitutional right to an adequate education in Part 2 of our constitution, the Form of Government, using language so obscure that nobody would discover said “right” for 200 years. (See, </span><span class="csE3E0FE0B">Wooster v. Plymouth</span><span class="csDD5E5F52">, “The division of the constitution into 2 Parts was not made without a purpose, and the name of each Part is not without significance.”); and</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">	Whereas, the framers of our constitution understood “rights” as freedom from government interference, the right to free speech has never been understood to mean that the government must provide one with a typewriter or fax machine, only that the government cannot prevent one from ventilating his or her viewpoint; in contrast, the “right” to an “adequate education” declared by our supreme court is a claim upon government, which is totally inconsistent with the nature of the types of rights recognized by the framers and, not surprisingly, the nature of the actual rights contained in our constitution; and</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">	Whereas, Part 1, Article 6 specifically stipulates that education is a local right; the right of the local communities to elect and contract with their own teachers must include the right to determine what is taught, the cost of that instruction, and the obligation to fund that cost through locally approved means (including local school taxes); and</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">	Whereas, the educational system that the supreme court declared unconstitutional and the provisions of the constitution that the supreme court relied upon to strike it down, peacefully co-existed for more than 200 years; New Hampshire’s locally controlled public schools that were locally funded through local school tax districts were arbitrarily transformed into one large school district, one large tax district for school tax purposes, and one uniform statewide tax rate which created arbitrary donor and receiver towns; therefore the assertion by the New Hampshire supreme court so late in our history that educational policy is a matter not for democratic decision making, but for constitutional law is absurd; and</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">	Whereas, the supreme court ignored the actions of the first legislatures under the 1784 Constitution, wherein they enacted the School Tax Law of 1789, which, through many re-enactments and amendments – whose constitutionality was never cast into doubt – served until 1919 as the model for public school funding: by taxes locally raised and locally applied; and</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">	Whereas, the Claremont decisions are irreconcilable with the structure, text, and history of our constitution; the “right” to an “adequate education” declared in the decisions and the “duty” of the state to fund this right are nothing more than the views of the justices of the supreme court of what constitutes good social policy and, therefore, do not have the force and effect of law; and</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">	Whereas, the legislature hereby finds and declares that the amount of state funding for public education required by the constitution has been and remains zero dollars, and that the legislature, not the supreme court, has the exclusive power and discretion to authorize any additional state funding, and that, to the extent not prohibited by Part 1, Article 28-a, the state may continue to delegate some or all of the responsibility for providing public education to the local school districts; now therefore, be it</span></p><p class="cs19DEA7BA" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">	Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring:</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">	That the legislature hereby finds and declares that the Claremont case’s mandates that the legislative and executive branches define an adequate education, determine its cost, fund its entire cost with state taxes, and ensure its delivery through accountability, are not binding on the legislative and executive branches.</span></p></body>
