  METHODOLOGY:

This bill requires health care providers to provide a cost quote for non-emergency medical services offered to a patient. 

 

The Insurance Department states this bill imposes a requirement on health care providers to provide cost quotes in certain situations. To the extent this increases provider costs, these costs may be passed onto insurers in the form of higher reimbursements. Increased costs may result in increased premiums, or may result in policy buy downs. Increased premiums may result in increased premium tax revenue to the State. 

 

The Department of Administrative Services states the fiscal impact to the State of New Hampshire Employee and Retiree Health Benefit Plan cannot be determined. The Plan is a governmental self-insured health benefit plan and not a provider of medical services or treatment. However, the Department is not able to project the longer term impact on the cost of care or the Fund if providers are locked into cost quotes.

 

The New Hampshire Association of Counties indicates this bill may have an indeterminable impact on county expenditures. The Association is not able to predict the number or variety of cost quotes requested and cannot determine the fiscal impact on county expenditures. 

 

The Department of Health and Human Services states this bill would have no fiscal impact on the Department.

 

The New Hampshire Municipal Association was not able to identify any impacts on municipal revenues or expenditures.
