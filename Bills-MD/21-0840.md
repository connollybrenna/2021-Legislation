  

HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 3

 

RESOLVED, that the following policy be established for the distribution of House calendars and journals, bills and resolutions to members of the General Court and state departments: 

 

1. Every citizen is entitled, free of charge, to one copy of any publication at the legislative counter or to have the publication mailed to that person upon individual request for one such copy. 

 

2. Persons requesting copies for the entire session will be charged a fee sufficient to cover postage, envelopes and handling. Such fees may be prorated when service is received for portions of the session only. All fees are payable in advance. The subscriber list may be submitted for legislative accounting and auditing purposes, but is not for publication or sale. 

 

3. All fees charged for publications in accordance with this resolution shall be fixed with the approval of the Speaker, paid into the state treasury and credited to the legislative appropriation.
