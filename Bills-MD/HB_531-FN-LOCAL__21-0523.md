 (1) Evidence of [residency] having established domicile, as set forth in RSA 654:1, I-a, at an institution of learning in that place; 

 2 Voters and Checklists; Temporary Absence or Presence. Amend RSA 654:2, III to read as follows:

 III. An individual applying for registration as a voter 30 or fewer days before an election shall use the election day registration form required by RSA 654:7, [IV(c)] III(c) which shall require the applicant to provide the date he or she established his or her voting domicile in New Hampshire. The registration form shall require the voter to identify and provide evidence of a verifiable action he or she has taken carrying out his or her intent to make the place claimed on the voter registration form his or her domicile.

 III. [If an applicant is unable to provide the proof of qualifications as required in RSA 654:12, he or she may register by completing the necessary affidavits, pursuant to RSA 654:12, and completing the form in subparagraph IV(b), unless the person is registering within 30 days before an election or at the polling place on election day. If an applicant is registering at the polling place on election day and is unable to provide the proof of qualifications as required in RSA 654:12, he or she may register by completing the form in subparagraph IV(c) under oath, which oath may be witnessed by an election official or any other person, working in conjunction with the supervisors of the checklist, who is authorized by law to administer oaths, including, but not limited to, any justice of the peace or notary public; should the applicant not otherwise have proof of identity and therefore be relying upon the form for proof of identity, the act of swearing to the form shall constitute sufficient proof of identity for the purposes of any person administering the oath, notwithstanding any language to the contrary in any laws relating to the administering of oaths for other purposes. 

 IV.](a) Standard registration application forms shall be used throughout the state. The registration forms shall be no larger than 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches.

 [I understand that if I have documentary evidence of my intent to be domiciled at this address when registering to vote, I must either present it at the time of registration or I must place my initials next to the following paragraph and mail a copy or present the document at the town or city clerk's office within 10 days following the election (30 days in towns where the clerk's office is open fewer than 20 hours weekly).

 Failing to report and provide evidence of a verifiable action will prompt official mail to be sent to your domicile address by the secretary of state to verify the validity of your claim to a voting domicile at this address. 

 I understand that if I do not have any documentary evidence of my intent to be domiciled at this address, I must place my initials next to the following paragraph:

The secretary of state shall prepare and distribute an addendum to the voter registration form used under subparagraph IV(c) to be distributed to those registrants who register within 30 days before the election or on election day and who do not provide proof of domicile or a verifiable action to demonstrate domicile. The "verifiable action of domicile" document shall provide notice of the requirements that registrants must furnish documentary evidence of domicile and shall be in substantially the following form: 

Verifiable Action of Domicile 

 As a newly registered voter, you have received this document because you did not provide proof of domicile when you registered to vote. RSA 654:2, IV requires you to provide evidence that you have taken a verifiable act to establish domicile. 

 The following checklist shall be used as a guide for what you may use as evidence and shall be submitted to the town or city clerk along with documentation that you are required to provide. Only one item on the list is required to demonstrate a verifiable act. 

 To establish that you have engaged in a verifiable act establishing domicile, provide evidence that you have done at least one of the following: 

 \_\_\_ established residency, as set forth in RSA 654:1, I-a, at an institution of learning at the address on the voter registration form 

 \_\_\_ rented or leased an abode, for a period of more than 30 days, to include time directly prior to an election day at the address listed on the voter registration form 

 \_\_\_ purchased an abode at the address listed on the voter registration form 

 \_\_\_ obtained a New Hampshire resident motor vehicle registration, driver's license, or identification card issued under RSA 260:21, RSA 260:21-a, or RSA 260:21-b listing the address on the voter registration form 

 \_\_\_ enrolled a dependent minor child in a publicly funded elementary or secondary school which serves the town or ward of the address where the registrant resides, as listed on the voter registration form

 \_\_\_ other government-issued forms or identification. Describe form of identification: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

 \_\_\_ provided the address on the voter registration form to the United States Post Office as your permanent address, provided it is not a postal service or commercial post office box, where mail is delivered to your home. This can be by listing the address on the voter registration form as your new address on a Postal Service permanent change of address form and providing a copy of the receipt, or an online emailed receipt 

 \_\_\_ obtained public utility services (electricity, cable, gas, water, etc.) for an indefinite period at the address on the voter registration form. List services obtained: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

 \_\_\_ arranged for a homeless shelter or similar service provider to receive United States mail on your behalf. Enter name of the shelter or provider: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

 \_\_\_ describe what other verifiable action or actions you have taken to make the address listed on your voter registration form your one voting domicile: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

 If you have no other proof of a verifiable act establishing domicile, and your domicile is at an abode rented, leased, or purchased by another and your name is not listed on the rental agreement, lease, or deed, you are required to provide a written statement, signed under penalty of voting fraud if false information is provided, from a person who is listed on such document, or other reasonable proof of ownership or control of the property, attesting that you reside at that address, signed by that person or his or her agent who manages the property. 

 This verifiable action of domicile form, along with your written statement or other documentation proving a verifiable act, shall be delivered to the town or city clerk, by mail or in person, with 10 days, or within 30 days if the clerk's office is open fewer than 20 hours weekly.

 (B) A person who attests under penalty of voter fraud that he or she does not possess any of the qualified documents listed in subparagraph (A) may present any reasonable documentation of having established a physical presence at the place claimed as domicile, having an intent to make that place his or her domicile, and having taken a verifiable act to carry out that intent. The documentation must establish that it is more likely than not that the applicant has a domicile and intends to maintain that domicile, as defined in this chapter, at least until election day in the town or ward in which he or she desires to vote. Reasonable documentation may include, but is not limited to evidence of:

 (2) Registering within 30 days before an election and on election day. 

 (A) When registering within 30 days before an election or on election day as provided in RSA 654:7-a, if the applicant does not have in his or her possession [at the polls] at the time the applicant seeks to register one of the qualified documents listed in subparagraph (1) or other reasonable documentation which establishes that it is more likely than not that the applicant has a domicile at the address claimed in the town or ward in which he or she desires to vote, [he or she may execute a sworn statement on the voter registration form used starting 30 days before an election and on election day and initial the acknowledgment of domicile evidence obligation. If the applicant identifies on his or her application action taken to establish his or her domicile, which he or she has documentation of, he or she must agree to mail a copy of or present the document in person to the city or town clerk within 10 days, or where the town clerk's office is open fewer than 20 hours weekly, within 30 days.

The supervisors of the checklist shall initiate removing the name from the checklist of any such person who fails to provide proof of domicile by the deadline by sending the person the notice required by RSA 654:44] the applicant shall be provisionally registered to vote and shall be permitted to cast a provisional ballot in that election, as provided in (B) below. 

 [(B) A person registering within 30 days before an election or on election day who does not possess reasonable documentation of establishing domicile and has taken no verifiable action to carry out his or her intent to establish domicile at the address claimed on the voter registration application may nonetheless register to vote by initialing the paragraph on the registration form acknowledging that domicile may be verified. The supervisors of the checklist shall, as soon as practical following an election at which the person initials such paragraph to register and vote, attempt to verify that the person was domiciled at the address claimed on election day by means including, but not limited to: 

 (i) Examining public records held by the town or city clerk, municipal assessing and planning offices, tax collector, or other municipal office that may house public records containing domicile confirmation; or 

 (ii) Requesting 2 or more municipal officers or their agents or state election officers or their agents to visit the address and verify that the individual was domiciled there on election day. In unincorporated places that have not organized for the purposes of conducting elections, county officers may be asked to perform this function; or 

 (iii) Referring the registrant's information to the secretary of state, who shall cause such further investigation as is warranted. 

 (C) Any case where supervisors are unable to verify the applicant's domicile or where evidence exists of voting fraud shall be promptly reported to the secretary of state and to the attorney general, who shall cause such further investigation as is warranted.] 

 (B)(i) A person seeking to register to vote within 30 days of an election or on election day who does not provide documentation which reasonably establishes that the person is domiciled in the town or ward in which the person seeks to vote shall be permitted to register to vote and to vote in that election, provided, however, that the registration shall be provisional and the person shall cast a provisional ballot. The checklist entry for such a person shall be clearly marked PROVISIONAL REGISTRATION and, unless converted to a regular registration as provided below, shall expire at the conclusion of the election held within 30 days of, or on the day of, the registration. The ballot given to such person shall be conspicuously marked PROVISIONAL BALLOT and shall be printed in a color that is clearly different from the color of regular ballots so that such ballots may be easily distinguished from regular ballots. The person shall be permitted to cast his or her provisional ballot in secret, whereupon the person shall immediately seal the ballot in an envelope to be provided by the moderator or other election official at the polling place. The person shall sign and print the person's name and address on the outside of the envelope and furnish the envelope to the election official. It shall be the responsibility of the moderator to maintain all such provisional ballots safely and securely under the moderator's custody and control and to keep them separate from all regular ballots cast at the election.

 (ii) After the polls close on election day, the moderator shall count all provisional ballot envelopes collected on election day and shall inform the person in charge of the counting of regular ballots of the total number of provisional ballots cast. 

 (iii) Not later than 5 days after the day of the election, the person casting a provisional ballot shall submit to the moderator such documentation as is described in subparagraph (c)(1) as reasonably establishes the person's domicile in the town or ward where the person voted on the date of the election. If the person provides such documentation, the envelope containing such person's provisional ballot shall be opened and that person's provisional ballot shall be counted as if it was a regular ballot and added to the total vote for the candidates for whom the person voted, and the checklist marking of PROVISIONAL REGISTRATION shall be removed such that the person shall thereafter be treated for all purposes as a duly registered voter. If the person does not provide such documentation as reasonably establishes such person's domicile in the town or ward where the person voted on the date of the election, the envelope containing such person's provisional ballot shall not be opened and such person's provisional ballot shall not be counted and added to the regular ballots cast in the election.

 (iv) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the moderator to count or not count a provisional ballot as if it was a regular ballot may challenge said decision by filing a complaint with the superior court within 3 days of the moderator's decision. The superior court shall cause a copy of the complaint to be immediately served upon the moderator, the supervisors of the checklist, and any other interested persons, shall promptly hear the matter, and shall order that the provisional ballot be counted or not counted as justice requires. The superior court's findings of fact shall be final unless clearly erroneous.

 II. The supervisors may refuse to add the name of an applicant to the checklist if he or she fails to present the evidence [or an affidavit] as required by this section. Without limiting the acceptance of other forms of proof of domicile or identity deemed reasonable by the supervisors: 

 (a) Any one of the following documents is presumptive evidence that the individual seeking to vote meets the domicile requirement, provided the document is currently valid, was issued to or in the name of the applicant, and shows the address the applicant claims as a domicile: 

 (1) New Hampshire driver's license. 

 (2) New Hampshire vehicle registration. 

 (3) Armed services identification, or other photo identification issued by the United States government. 

 (b) Any one of the following is presumptive evidence of the identity of an applicant sufficient to satisfy the identity requirement [for an official authorized by RSA 659:30 to take the oath of an applicant swearing to a qualified voter, domicile, or election day affidavit or a sworn statement on the voter registration form used starting 30 days before an election and on election day]: 

 (1) Photo driver's license issued by any state or the federal government. 

 (2) United States passport, armed services identification, or other photo identification issued by the United States government. 

 (3) Photo identification issued by local or state government. 

 (c) The presumptions established in this paragraph may be defeated by evidence establishing that it is more likely than not that the applicant is not qualified as a voter. 

 III. To prove the qualifications set forth in paragraphs I and II, an applicant for registration as a voter must prove his or her identity to establish that the evidence used to prove age, citizenship, and domicile relate to the applicant. A person who has in his or her immediate possession a photo identification approved for use by paragraph II must present that identification when applying for registration. A person who does not have an approved photo identification with him or her may establish identity [through completion of the qualified voter affidavit, which shall be retained in accordance with RSA 33-A:3-a, or a sworn statement on the voter registration form used starting 30 days before an election and on election day] in any other manner that reasonably establishes that it is more likely than not that the person is who he or she claims to be. Residents of a nursing home or similar facility may prove their identity through verification of identity by the administrator of the facility or by his or her designee. For the purposes of this section, the application of a person whose identity has been verified by an official of a nursing home or similar facility shall be treated in the same manner as the application of a person who proved his or her identity with a photo identification. 

 IV. Any person who is applying for registration as a voter and who is currently registered to vote in a different town or ward in New Hampshire shall complete the voter registration form provided for in RSA 654:7. If the election official receiving the application confirms through the centralized voter registration database required by RSA 654:45 that the applicant is currently registered to vote in New Hampshire, the applicant shall prove identity and domicile, but shall not be required to prove his or her age or citizenship. 

 V.(a) The election official approving the application for registration as voter of a person who does not present an approved form of photo identification as proof of identity when registering, shall mark the voter registration form to indicate that no photo identification was presented and shall inform the person that, if he or she is a first-time election day registrant in New Hampshire, he or she will receive a letter of identity verification. The person entering the voter information into the centralized voter registration database shall determine if the person is listed in the system as having been previously registered in the town or ward reported by the applicant on the voter registration form. If the person is a new registrant who has not been previously registered anywhere in New Hampshire or if the centralized voter registration database does not confirm a previous registration claimed on the voter registration form, the election official shall cause the record created in the centralized voter registration database to indicate that the person is a new applicant in New Hampshire and that no photo identification was presented. When municipalities enter information on people who register on election day into the centralized voter registration database, to the extent practical applicants who are registering for the first time in New Hampshire and who also register without presenting an approved photo identification shall be entered first. [The person entering the voter information of election day residents into the centralized voter registration database shall cause the records to indicate if the voter executed a sworn statement on the voter registration form used starting 30 days before an election and on election day.]

 (b) The secretary of state shall cause a letter of identity verification to be mailed by first class mail to each voter identified at any election as a first-time election day registrant in New Hampshire who also did not verify his or her identity with an approved photo identification. The letter shall be mailed by January 10 in every odd-numbered year in the case of persons registering at a state primary or general election, or within 90 days after any other election. The secretary of state shall mark the envelope with instructions to the United States Post Office not to forward the letter and to provide address correction information. The letter shall notify the person that a person who was unable to present photo identification registered or registered and voted using his or her name and address and instruct the person to return the letter within 45 days with a written confirmation that the person registered and voted or to contact the attorney general immediately if he or she did not register and vote. Any voter under a protective order pursuant to RSA 173-B, and whose name does not appear on the checklist as provided under RSA 654:25, shall not be subject to the provisions of paragraph V. 

 (c) The secretary of state shall conduct an inquiry regarding any letters mailed pursuant to subparagraph (b) that are returned as undeliverable by the United States Post Office and those persons who were mailed letters under subparagraph (b) and have not confirmed their registration. The inquiry may include consulting with, and examining public records held by[,] municipal officials, which contain information relevant to a person's qualifications to vote in New Hampshire, and interviewing persons living at the address listed on the voter registration form. After such inquiry, the secretary of state shall prepare and forward to the attorney general for investigation a list of those people whose identity or eligibility to vote could not be confirmed. Upon receipt of notice from a person who receives a letter of identity verification that the person did not register and vote, or upon receipt of a referral from the secretary of state, the attorney general shall cause an investigation to be made to determine whether fraudulent registration or voting occurred. 

 (d) [Within 90 days of each election, the secretary of state shall cause a list of persons executing sworn statements on the voter registration form used starting 30 days before an election and on election day since the prior election to be forwarded to the attorney general and the division of motor vehicles. The secretary of state shall send a letter to each such person informing him or her of a driver's obligation to obtain a New Hampshire driver's license within 60 days of becoming a New Hampshire resident. The letter shall be mailed within 60 days after the election, except that if the election is a state primary election, the letter shall be mailed 60 days after the general election, and if the election is a regularly scheduled municipal election, the letter shall be mailed by the July 1 or January 1 next following the election. The secretary of state shall mark the envelope with instructions to the United States Post Office not to forward the letter and to provide address correction information. 

 (e) The secretary of state shall conduct an inquiry regarding any letters mailed pursuant to subparagraph (d) that are returned as undeliverable by the United States Post Office. The inquiry may include consulting with, and examining public records held by, municipal officials, which contain information relevant to a person's qualifications to vote in New Hampshire, and interviewing persons living at the address listed on the letters. After such inquiry, the secretary of state shall prepare and forward to the attorney general for investigation a list of those people whose eligibility to vote could not be confirmed. The attorney general shall cause an investigation to be made to determine whether fraudulent registration or voting occurred. 

 (f)] Upon completion of any investigation authorized under RSA 654:12, the secretary of state and the attorney general shall forward a report summarizing the results of the inquiry and investigation, respectively, to the speaker of the house of representatives, the president of the senate, and the chairpersons of the appropriate house and senate standing committees with jurisdiction over election law. 

 6 Election Day Morning Procedures; Statutes Posted. Amend RSA 658:29 to read as follows:

 658:29 Statutes Posted. The secretary of state shall prepare and distribute copies of the following RSA sections which the selectmen shall post or cause to be posted outside the guardrail in the polling place at all elections: RSA 654:7-a, RSA 654:7-b; RSA 659:13, RSA 659:13-b, RSA 659:27, RSA 659:30, [RSA 659:31,] RSA 659:32, RSA 659:34, RSA 659:35, RSA 659:37, RSA 659:38, RSA 659:40, RSA 659:41, RSA 659:103; RSA 666:4, RSA 666:5, RSA 666:8. In addition, the secretary of state shall include any other statutes or regulations that are required to be posted by state or federal law. The secretary of state may also include statutes or regulations that, in the secretary of state's judgment, would aid a voter in casting a vote or in contacting the appropriate official if the voter believes that his or her voting rights are being violated. 

 7 Challenge of Voter. Amend RSA 659:27, II-III to read as follows:

 II. Upon receipt of a written challenge, the moderator shall determine if the challenge to the ballot is well grounded. If the moderator determines that it is more likely than not that the challenge is well grounded, the moderator shall not receive the vote of the person so challenged [until the person signs and gives to the moderator an affidavit in the following form: I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, do solemnly swear (or affirm) under penalties of voter fraud, that I am the identical person whom I represent myself to be, that I am a duly qualified voter of this town (or ward), and have a legal domicile therein. My telephone number (requested but optional) is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and my email address (requested but optional) is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]. If the moderator determines that the challenge is not well grounded, the moderator shall permit the [voter to proceed] challenged person to vote. 

 [III. No voter or appointed challenger shall challenge a person's qualifications to be a voter at the election day voter registration table.]

METHODOLOGY:

This bill establishes a provisional voter registration and voting process. It eliminates the use of the qualified voter affidavit forwarded to the Department of Justice by the Secretary of State for investigation when an individual's qualifications cannot be confirmed. 

 

The Department of Justice works with the Secretary of State's office to provide training and guidance to election officials. Eliminating the voter affidavit and associated investigation while introducing new provisional registration and voting procedures will require revision of guidance materials and additional training for election officials. The resulting overall impact on the workload of the department is unknown and therefore the fiscal impact is indeterminable.

 

The Department of State indicates it is unsure if the provisions of this bill would require additional compliance with the National Voter Registration Act ("Motor Voter") and incur additional significant costs associated with this legislation.

 

The New Hampshire Municipal Association states there will be minimal change to the work of election officials and no resulting significant effect on municipal expenditures as a result of this bill. There should be no effect on municipal revenues.

 

This bill contains penalties that may have an impact on the New Hampshire judicial and correctional systems. There is no method to determine how many charges would be brought as a result of the changes contained in this bill to determine the fiscal impact on expenditures. However, the entities impacted have provided the potential costs associated with these penalties below.

  It should be noted that average case cost estimates for FY 2021 and FY 2022 are based on data that is more than ten years old and does not reflect changes to the courts over that same period of time or the impact these changes may have on processing the various case types. An unspecified misdemeanor can be either class A or class B, with the presumption being a class B misdemeanor.

  It should be noted that a person needs to be found indigent and have the potential of being incarcerated to be eligible for indigent defense services. The majority of indigent cases (approximately 85%) are handled by the public defender program, with the remaining cases going to contract attorneys (14%) or assigned counsel (1%).

Many offenses are prosecuted by local and county prosecutors. When the Department of Justice has investigative and prosecutorial responsibility or is involved in an appeal, the Department would likely absorb the cost within its existing budget. If the Department needs to prosecute significantly more cases or handle more appeals, then costs may increase by an indeterminable amount. 

 

It is assumed this bill will be effective July 1, 2021.
