METHODOLOGY:

This bill limits the conditions under which seized property may be transferred to a federal agency. The Department of Justice indicates the bill prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from entering into agreements with the federal government to allow the federal government to take custody of property valued at less than $100,000.00 for the purposes of forfeiting that property pursuant to federal law. In the context of drug-related crimes, the Attorney General’s Office handles all forfeiture proceedings. This bill would increase the number of forfeiture proceedings the Attorney General’s Office must handle because state and local law enforcement would no longer be able to work with the federal government to forfeit money or property. It is not clear how many additional forfeiture cases this bill would create. Therefore, this bill’s fiscal impact is indeterminable.

 

The New Hampshire Municipal Association states this legislation bars state, county, and municipal law enforcement agencies from entering into agreements with federal agencies to allow the federal government to engage in “adoptive forfeiture”; the process by which the federal government brings a forfeiture case without being involved in building the case except where $100,000 in U.S. currency is involved, and unless the seizure of the property took place under the auspices of an intergovernmental joint task force. The Association indicates the bill would, presumably, cut some portion of the incoming equitable share due to the restriction on how municipal law enforcement agency may turn over property to the federal government. The impact on county revenue and expenditures cannot be determined.
