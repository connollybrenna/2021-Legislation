METHODOLOGY:

This bill:


 * Adds a new provision to specify that interest on any tax amount paid after the date of the original or reissued tax bill is not applicable if paid within 30 days of the tax bill. 
* Removes the telefile option for filing of Meals and Rooms Tax returns. 
* Removes a reference to weighted apportionment factors under RSA 77-A:3, II(a) in the annual tax expenditure report.
* Specifies the timeline for filing of Business Profits Tax and Business Enterprise Tax returns for non-profit business organizations

  

The Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) indicates the provision relating to the 30 day tax payment window may have an indeterminable fiscal impact due to an unknown amount of taxes that would not be paid or what would be paid within 30 days of a tax bill. If an amount is paid within 30 days, then there may be a decrease in state revenues. Administrative expenses may decrease due to a reduction in small account balances that require manual processing.

 

DRA indicates operators using the current telefile system may file electronically using the new online portal Granite State Connect as part of the Revenue Information System (RIMS) or they may use paper returns. This would not affect state revenues but would decrease state expenditures by approximately $100,000 per year.

 

DRA states there is no fiscal impact relating to the removal of the reference to the weighted apportionment formula in the Tax Expenditure Report. The sections relating to Â·the timeline for filing of Business Profits Tax and Business Enterprise Tax returns for non-profit business organizations conform to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and have no fiscal impact. 

 

It is assumed this bill will be effective July 1, 2021.
