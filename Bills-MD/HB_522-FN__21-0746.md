STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

 

In the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Twenty One

 

AN ACT relative to motor vehicle inspections for new vehicles.

 

Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened:

 

 1 Equipment of Vehicles; Inspection Authorized. Amend RSA 266:1, II to read as follows:

 II. Any new vehicle that is under warranty and owned by a natural person and registered under this title, except an OHRV, snowmobile, moped, roadable aircraft, or other exempt vehicle, shall be inspected once [a year] every two years, during the month in which the birth date of the owner is observed[, if the owner is a natural person]. Any other vehicle that is registered under this title, except an OHRV, snowmobile, moped, roadable aircraft, or other exempt vehicle shall be inspected once a year, during the month in which the birth date of the owner is observed. An inspection sticker shall be valid for the same duration as the vehicle's registration[, which shall not exceed 16 months]. If the month in which the anniversary of the owner's birth occurs will be one of the next 4 months, an inspection sticker may be issued, with an expiration date of the birth month in the following year, of the first person named on the title application. Nothing in this paragraph shall require any person who has registered and had inspected a vehicle with temporary plates to have the vehicle reinspected upon receipt of permanent motor vehicle plates. An inspection sticker shall not expire when a vehicle is transferred to a licensed dealer.

 2 Effective Date. This act shall take effect 60 days after its passage.

METHODOLOGY:

This bill requires new vehicles under warranty and owned by an individual to be inspected every two years in place of the current regulation, which requires all vehicles to be inspected annually. The Department of Safety is unclear as to the definition of a “new vehicle” for determining this bill’s applicability, and therefore is unable to provide an estimate as to how many vehicles this could apply to annually. This bill will reduce state highway fund revenue in FY 2022, and each year thereafter, by an indeterminable amount. Also, pursuant to RSA 235:23 (“Apportionment A”), 12 percent of road toll and motor vehicle fees collected are distributed to municipalities, which means under this bill state expenditures and local revenue would decrease by an indeterminable amount beginning FY 2023. The Department estimates one-time programming costs for the changes required by this bill would be incurred in FY 2022 and be less than $10,000.
