  METHODOLOGY:

This bill prohibits the Commissioner of the Department of Transportation including in the 10 year transportation improvement plan any ramp toll plazas or open road tolls in the town of Merrimack unless tolls are placed in other locations on the F.E. Everett Turnpike that have more traffic. Without knowing specific tolling locations, the Department is unable to estimate changes in traffic volumes and revenue along the F.E Everett Turnpike and therefore cannot estimate the fiscal impact of this bill.
