  *The New Hampshire Retirement System states it is not able to separate the fiscal impact of this legislation between county and local government, therefore the fiscal impact is shown together as political subdivisions.

 

METHODOLOGY:

This bill extends the 30 year amortization period for the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS) unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) as of June 30, 2017 by 5 years from 2039 to 2044. Employer contribution rates for FY22 and FY23 are unaffected by this proposed change, as the rates have already been certified, so there is no impact on employer expenditures in those fiscal years. As of June 30, 2019, the NHRS was 60.8% funded with an UAAL of $5.9 billion. The proposal would decrease employer contributions during the initial amortization period and would cause the unfunded liability to decrease at a much slower rate.

 

Starting in FY24 through FY39 there would be approximately $1.3 billion in savings in reduced employer contribution rates as a result of this bill. However, there will be additional employer contributions totaling $2.7 billion over the additional five year extension proposed in the bill. The net impact of the additional 5 years of payments is an additional $1.4 billion over the entire amortization period. The initial liability as of June 30, 2017 is currently scheduled to be paid off by June 30, 2039. Under the proposal, the initial liability as of June 30, 2039 would be approximately $2.3 billion.

Assuming an annual rate of return of 6.75 percent and payroll growth of 2.75 percent per year (2.25 percent for teachers) the NHRS actuary determined the following:
