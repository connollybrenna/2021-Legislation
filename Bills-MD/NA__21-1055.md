Memorializing Richard W. Hinch of Merrimack

 

WHEREAS, we learned with profound sorrow that Representative Richard W. Hinch passed away a week after being elected Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives; and

WHEREAS, a dedicated patriot, Richard W. Hinch proudly and honorably served his nation in the United States Navy and always had a US Navy lapel pin on whatever jacket he may be wearing; and 

WHEREAS, “Dick” Hinch was recently elected to his seventh term in the New Hampshire House, representing the town of Merrimack, a community he profoundly loved and served in various roles, including as a Selectman, Budget Committee Member, and Chair of the Public Library Development Committee; and 

WHEREAS, “Dick” Hinch was a friend, colleague, and mentor to many members in the House of Representatives over his twelve years in the State House, often holding court in the cafeteria enjoying breakfast with members from across the political spectrum; and 

WHEREAS, “Dick” Hinch had an infectious laugh, was always quick to offer a hug, and even on the most difficult days where partisanship was prevalent, would seek to make his opponents smile and suggest things were “more betterer” leaving it on the floor; now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives in Regular Session convened, Richard W. Hinch be granted the highest praise and accolades and our profound thanks for his service to his country, the state, and the town he called home for many years, and, be it further

RESOLVED, that expressions of our most heartfelt sympathy be extended to his family and that a suitable copy of this Resolution be prepared for presentation to them.

 

 

Offered by the House of Representatives.
