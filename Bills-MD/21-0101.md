A RESOLUTION calling for the Netflix show "Cuties" to be taken off the air.

 

 Whereas, Netflix markets the film, "Cuties" (Mignonnes), as, "Eleven-year-old Amy starts to rebel against her conservative family's traditions when she becomes fascinated with a free-spirited dance crew"; and

 Whereas, the film has been described as 7 minutes of close ups on the shorts and breast area of underage girls twerking and grinding in front of the camera; and

 Whereas, the film shows an underage girl removing her top and exposing her breasts; and

 Whereas, scenes in the film show an 11-year-old girl's jeans pulled down and revealing her bare buttocks, one girl taking a video of a boy's penis, publishing a photo of her genitals, and wearing a white t-shirt while having water splashed on her chest; and

 Whereas, online petitions calling for this film to be removed have gathered over 2 million signatures; and

 Whereas, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard referred to the film as "child porn," and other reviewers described the film as "soft child porn"; and

 Whereas, Senator Tom Cotton described Netflix's decision to promote the film as, "disgusting at best and a serious crime at worst”; and

 Whereas, Congressman Jim Banks argued that "the DOJ should be readying charges against Netflix for distribution of child pornography"; and

 Whereas, Senator Ted Cruz reminds the Department of Justice in his request that Netflix be investigated for airing this film, “Although the First Amendment provides vigorous protection for artistic expression, it does not allow individuals or for-profit corporations to produce or distribute child pornography”; and

 Whereas, the entertainment industry has released a steady stream of imagery that sexualizes children and teens, such as Kids, Lolita (1997), Thirteen (2003), Pretty Baby, music videos, preteens in provocative outfits in fashion shows, dolls and toys that are increasingly sexualized, and programming aimed at young children with revealing attire; and

 Whereas, Hollywood has recently been exposed for decades of drug-fueled parties involving children as young as 12, extreme sexual harassment, sexual assault of men and women, and sexual abuse of minors, especially child actors; now, therefore, be it 

 Resolved by the House of Representatives:

 That the house clerk send copies of this resolution to Netflix to remove this film from distribution and to the United States Department of Justice to investigate whether the movie violates laws against exploitation of minors under 18 U.S.C. section 2251 and section 2252 and consider prosecution of Netflix and those who chose to put this content in front of millions of viewers.
