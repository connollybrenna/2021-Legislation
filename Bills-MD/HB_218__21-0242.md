AN ACT repealing RSA 321 regarding itinerant vendors.

 

Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened:

 

 1 Powers and Duties of Towns; Regulation of Hawkers, Peddlers and Vendors; Cross Reference to RSA 321 Removed. Amend the introductory paragraph of RSA 31:102-a to read as follows:

 31:102-a Hawkers, Peddlers and Vendors. The governing board of a city, town or village district may adopt, by ordinance or regulation, provisions for the licensure and regulation of itinerant vendors, hawkers, peddlers, traders, farmers, merchants, or other persons who sell, offer to sell, or take orders for merchandise from temporary or transient sales locations within a town or who go from town to town or place to place within a town for such purposes. Any person who violates any provision of such ordinance or regulation shall be guilty of a class B misdemeanor, and each continuing day of violation after notice shall constitute a separate offense. A city, town, or village district shall be specifically prohibited, however, from licensing or regulating a candidate for public office in the process of obtaining signatures on nomination papers, who seeks to have the candidate's name placed on the ballot for the state general election by submitting nomination papers under RSA 655:40. Provisions adopted under this section shall be in addition to any requirements imposed by the state under [either] RSA 320 [or RSA 321] and may include, but shall not be limited to: 

 2 Repeal. The following are repealed:

 I. RSA 321, relative to itinerant vendors.

 II. RSA 320:3, I, referencing itinerant vendors under RSA 321.
