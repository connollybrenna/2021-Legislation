AN ACT relative to police disciplinary hearings.

 

Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened:

 

 1 Police Standards and Trainings; Hearings. Amend RSA 106-L:5, III to read as follows:

 III. For the purposes of a disciplinary hearing, subpoena and examine witnesses under oath, take oaths or affirmations, and reduce to writing testimony given at any hearing. Any person whose rights or privileges may be affected at such a disciplinary hearing may appear with witnesses and be represented by counsel. Any disciplinary hearing shall be public; however, a portion of the hearing may be closed to the public only if the party seeking closure can prove with specificity that the portion of the hearing will reveal confidential information that creates a compelling interest outweighing the publicâ€™s presumed right of access.

 2 Effective Date. This act shall take effect upon its passage.
