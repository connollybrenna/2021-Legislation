  METHODOLOGY:

This bill will remove the contingency rate adjustments to the business profits tax (BPT) and business enterprise tax (BET) for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2021. The bill also reduces the BPT rate from 7.7 percent to 7.6 percent for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2021 and further reduces the rate from 7.6 percent to 7.5 percent for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2022. The BET rate will reduce from 0.60 percent to 0.55 percent for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2021 and further reduces the rate from 0.55 percent to 0.50 percent for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2022. 

 

The Department of Revenue Administration states the fiscal impact is indeterminable as the Department is not able to predict future business tax revenue. Based on the following assumptions, the Department is able to estimate a possible fiscal impact: 

 


 * to calculate FY 2021 thru FY 2024 revenues, the FY 2020 cash basis business tax revenue plus anomalous receivable revenue (revenue received in FY 2021 that is credited back to FY 2020) of $697,472,623 (BET revenue of $258,511,460 and BPT revenue of $438,961,163) is the starting point for calculating fiscal impact; 
* due to FY 2020 including a small amount (approx. 15%) of revenue attributable to tax year (TY) 2018 which had a BPT rate of 7.9 percent and a BET rate of 0.675 percent, the Department adjusted the FY 2020 cash basis revenue assuming the BPT rate of 7.7 percent and BET rate of 0.60 percent. This recalculation resulted in the total expected business tax revenue of $691,497,158 under current law. 
* based on a tax year revenue analysis of FY 2020 revenue, 15 percent is attributable to tax year 2018, 63 percent is attributable to tax year 2019, and 22 percent is attributable to tax year 2020; and,
* applying the split to FY 2020 revenue as well as applying the applicable rates creates a base of $48,046,301,704 (BET:$42,367,155,963 + BPT:$5,679,145,741) to use for the starting point of the calculating the fiscal impact.
* the proposed rate changes are then applied to the applicable tax to provide an estimated impact on the tax revenue.

  

The following tables provide the tax rates and any changes under current law and as proposed in this bill. The last table provides an estimated impact the rate changes will have on revenue.

The fiscal impact of the proposed rate reductions as depicted in the above table may be overstated or understated for future years depending on whether actual revenue is more or less than the FY 2020 cash basis revenue plus the anomalous receivable revenue (revenue received in FY 2021 that is credited back to FY 2020).
