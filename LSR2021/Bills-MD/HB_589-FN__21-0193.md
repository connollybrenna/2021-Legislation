METHODOLOGY:

This bill expands the definition of “critical exposure” under the workers’ compensation law. The Municipal Associations states existing law requires a workers’ compensation insurance carrier to pay all expenses associated with preventive medical treatment for emergency response and public safety workers who have experienced a critical exposure. 

 

The New Hampshire Municipal Association indicates, by expanding the definition of critical exposure, the law may require workers’ compensation to cover post-exposure treatment in more cases, but immediate post-exposure treatment may reduce long-term medical costs. A net increase or decrease in medical costs may affect workers’ compensation rates paid by municipalities. The Association does not have sufficient information to determine what the fiscal impact on expenditures would be. The Association assumes there should be no effect on municipal revenues.

 

The Department of Labor indicates the proposed legislation would not impact state, county or local revenues. The Department states the adjusted definition could lead to an increase in expenditures at the state, county and local levels. The proposed definition of critical exposure could lead to added workers' compensation coverage and treatment costs This assumes additional exposures (saliva, tears and perspiration) that could be covered even in the absence of noticeable blood contaminant. The Department has deemed these potential increases in expenditures as “indeterminable” because there is no way to credibly quantify the increase in claims (if any), or what the adjustment in premiums and coverage costs may be. 

 

The Department of Safety is not able to determine the potential impact of the updated definition on the number of workers' compensation claims. Therefore, the Department cannot determine the fiscal impact on State, local or county expenditures.
