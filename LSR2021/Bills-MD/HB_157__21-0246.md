STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

 

In the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Twenty One

 

AN ACT repealing the state health assessment and state health improvement plan council.

 

Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened:

 

 1 Statement of Intent. The general court finds that Section 501(r)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code requires community hospitals to do a community needs assessment every 3 years, and the stated intent of the state health assessment is entirely duplicative of the collective effort of New Hampshireâ€™s 26 acute care hospitals in this regard. The general court also finds the state health improvement plan would undo the good work of SB 481 (2016), which repealed certificate of need in New Hampshire, removing state government from health care planning, and allowing increased competition to reduce health care costs in New Hampshire. The general court therefore repeals the following statutes.

 2 Repeal. The following are repealed:

 I. RSA 126-A:87, relative to the state health improvement plan.

 II. RSA 126-A:88, relative to the state health assessment and state health improvement plan advisory council.

 3 Effective Date. This act shall take effect upon its passage.
