 432:3 State Plan. The department is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to formulate and submit to the Secretary of Agriculture, in conformity with the provisions of said Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, a state plan for each year. It shall be the purpose of each such plan and each such plan shall be designed to promote such utilization of land and such farming practices as the department finds will tend, in conjunction with the operation of such other plans as may be approved for other states by the Secretary of Agriculture, to preserve and improve soil fertility and soil health; to promote mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and environmental change; to promote the economic use and conservation of land; to diminish exploitation and wasteful and unscientific use of natural soil resources; to protect rivers and waterways against the results of soil erosion and aid in flood control; and to reestablish and maintain the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms and that of the income per person not on farms, as defined in subsection (a) of section 7 of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act. Each such plan shall provide for adjustments in utilization of land, and in farming practices through agreements with producers or through other voluntary methods, and for benefit payments in connection therewith, and for such methods of administration not in conflict with any law of the state, and for such reports as the Secretary of Agriculture finds necessary for the effective administration of the plan, and for ascertaining whether the plan is being carried out according to its terms.

It is the intent of this subdivision to facilitate the joint effort of landowners, land occupiers, and units of government in carrying out measures for the conservation and development of lands within the district, voluntarily and with such assistance as may be available for this purpose from local, state, or federal governmental agencies.

 VI. "Healthy soils practices" mean agricultural practices that improve the health of soils, including but not limited to consideration of depth of topsoil horizons, water infiltration rate, organic carbon content, nutrient content, bulk density, biological activity, biological and microbiological diversity, and minimization of bare ground. 

 VII. "Mitigation" means a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gasses and reduce, prevent, or reverse other causes of climate and environmental change.

 4 Creation of Conservation Districts; Soil Health. Amend RSA 432:12 to read as follows:

 432:12 Creation of Conservation Districts.

In making such determinations the committee may accept petitions and conduct such public meetings and referenda as it deems necessary, and shall give due consideration to the distribution and intensity of erosion, floodwaters and sediment damages, need for land drainage, [and] changes in land use and the conservation, and development of the natural resources, the impact of climate and environmental change, and the promotion of practices to mitigate and adapt to a changing climate and environment on land within the said district, and to other relevant factors. From and after the date of adoption by the committee of a resolution in favor of the operation of a particular district, such district shall be deemed to be duly organized, and the supervisors of such district shall thereupon be entitled to exercise the powers conferred on them by this subdivision.
