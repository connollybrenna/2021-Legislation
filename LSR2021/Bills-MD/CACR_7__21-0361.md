The Governor shall be responsible for the faithful execution of the laws. He may, by appropriate court action or proceeding brought in the name of the State, enforce compliance with any constitutional or legislative mandate, or restrain violation of any constitutional or legislative power, duty, or right, by any officer, department or agency of the State.

The votes for Governor and Lieutenant-governor shall be received, sorted, counted, certified and returned, in the same manner as the votes for Senators; and the Secretary shall lay the same before the Senate and House of Representatives, on the first Wednesday following the first Tuesday of January to be by them examined, and in case of an election by a plurality of votes through the state, the choice shall be by them declared and published. And the qualifications of electors of the 

Governor shall be the same as those for Senators; and if no [person] persons shall have a plurality of votes, the Senate and House of Representatives shall, by joint ballot elect [one of] the[ two] respective persons, having the highest number of votes, who shall be declared Governor and Lieutenant-governor. And no person shall be eligible to [this] either office, unless at the time of his election, he shall have been an inhabitant of this State for 7 years next preceding, and unless he shall be of the age of 30 years.

 [Art.] 49. [[President of Senate] Lieutenant Governor, etc., To Act as Governor When Office Vacant; [Speaker of House President of Senate to Act When Office of Lieutenant Governor Is also Vacant.] In the event of the death, resignation, removal from office, failure to qualify, physical or mental incapacity, absence from the State, or other incapacity of the Governor, the [president of the senate] Lieutenant-governor, for the time being, shall act as Governor until the vacancy is filled or the incapacity is removed; and if the [president of the senate] Lieutenant-governor, for any of the above named causes, shall become incapable of performing the duties of Governor, the same shall devolve upon the [speaker of the house of representatives] President of the Senate, for the time being, or in the case of the like incapacity of the [speaker] President, upon the[ secretary of state] Speaker of the House of Representatives, or in case of his like incapacity, upon the [state treasurer] Secretary of State, each of whom, in that order, shall act as Governor, as hereinabove provided, until the vacancy is filled or the incapacity removed.

 VI. That if the proposed amendment is approved by 2/3 of those voting on the amendment, it becomes effective when the governor proclaims its adoption.

 VII. Voters' Guide.

 AT THE PRESENT TIME, there is no office of lieutenant governor in New Hampshire. In the event a governor is incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform the duties of the office, the constitution provides that the president of the senate shall assume the duties of the governor. If the president of the senate is unable to assume or perform the duties of the governor, the constitution provides that speaker of the house of representatives, the secretary of state, or the state treasurer would act as governor, in that order. 

 IF THE AMENDMENT IS ADOPTED, there will be a lieutenant-governor, elected jointly with the governor. If the governor were to become incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform the duties of the office, the lieutenant-governor would be the first in order of succession to assume the duties of governor, followed by the president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the secretary of state.
