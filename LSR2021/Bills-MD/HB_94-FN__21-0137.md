METHODOLOGY:

This bill would change the license renewal cycle for certain professions regulated by the Office of Professional Licensure from an every other year (odd or even) basis to 2 years from date of license issuance. This change will not affect the total amount collected but will redistribute the funds throughout each year. Partial license periods under current law allow for between 5 and 20 months. The bill allows for proration of licenses issued for more than 2 years during the transition period, which will not affect revenue from these transitioned licenses. However, some individuals would be required to renew their license and pay the $110 renewal fee even without having a full 2 years of licensure. Late fees would be eliminated but early reinstatement fee s would continue. The OPLC is unable to determine how licensing revenue and late fees would be impacted on an annual basis as licensing applications and late fees vary from year to year but total fees collected as a result of these proposed changes should not vary by any significant amount.

 

It is assumed this bill will not take effect until FY 2022.
