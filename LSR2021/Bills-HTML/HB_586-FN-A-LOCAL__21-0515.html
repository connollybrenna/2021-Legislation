<p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The OSI indicates the requirements related to free training for planning and zoning board members could be interpreted broadly for the provision of course materials and reasonable access to training and tests statewide, resulting in an indeterminable fiscal impact on the agency's expenditures.  </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The OSI also states the proposed housing champion certification program for municipalities is to be administered by the office, but the uncertain nature of a voluntary program and its cyclical nature makes it difficult to reliably anticipate associated staffing needs.  The additional responsibilities involved in adopting rules, establishing program qualifications,, consulting with relevant state agencies and entities to avoid conflicts and providing an annual report and overall program impact and assessment of additional housing units produced is beyond the office's current scope of work, necessitating an indeterminable increase in state expenditures to fulfill these requirements..</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The New Hampshire Municipal Association (NHMA) indicates municipalities may utilize the provisions  of RSA 162-K and RSA 79-E and may experience a shift in property tax revenues, without necessarily increasing or decreasing such revenues.  Results would vary on a town by town basis.  A municipality that qualifies as a housing champion may receive additional revenues associated with state infrastructure funding awards, but such amounts are unknown.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">NHMA also states other provisions of the bill may negatively impact municipal expenditures, but due to the unknown number or extent of such occurrences, such impact is indeterminable.  These provisions relate to the posting of a bond if a municipality appeals a land use board decision if ordered by a court, and the awarding of attorney fees if a land use board decision is reversed on appeal and such board acted with gross negligence, in bad faith or with malice.  Municipal revenue may increase if a land use board decision is upheld on appeal and the appealing party acted in bad faith or with malice and attorney fees are awarded.  Due to the unknown frequency of such an event the fiscal impact on municipal revenue is indeterminable.  The other provisions of the bill are unlikely to affect municipal revenue or expenditures.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Department of Revenue Administration indicates that a municipality that adopts RSA 162-K may experience an indeterminable revenue and expenditure impact based on the details of such tax increment financing and project expenses.  A municipality that adopts RSA 79-E and grants tax relief under the expanded duration periods will experience a redistribution of the overall tax burden but no drop in total revenue.  The Department cannot project any impact on municipal expenditures associated with the changes to this provision.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Judicial Branch indicates over the last 2 years, it has received 25-30 planning board appeals and 27-45 zoning board appeals.  There are a number of existing laws, in addition to Constitutional requirements, that require expedited review or have deadlines by which a decision is required.  Adding additional cases with compressed time frames may necessitate additional resources to fulfill these requirements.  Changes implemented effective 60 days after passage rather than the traditional January 1st of the following year pursuant to RSA 14:9-a will affect the Branch's ability to make changes collectively from all legislation.  This may result in duplicative efforts and expenditures for training of judges and staff, updating databases, modifying forms and changes to the e-filing system.  The overall impact on expenditures is indeterminable.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">It is assumed the bill will take effect July 1, 2021.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375"><span class="cs5925EB86">AGENCIES CONTACTED:</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">Office of Strategic Initiatives, New Hampshire Municipal Association, Department of Revenue Administration and Judicial Branch</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="cs2C11128C"> </span></p></body>
