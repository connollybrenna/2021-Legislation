This act may be known and cited as the New Hampshire religious liberty act.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span><a name="Chapt2"></a><span class="csDD5E5F52">2  Legislative Findings.  The general court finds that:</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		I.  The framers of our federal and state constitutions made the value judgment that religion warrants distinct protections.  “In matters of Religion, no mans right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society… Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance.” James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		II.  The right to the free exercise of religion, in both the federal and New Hampshire constitutions, was not meant to be a vague sentiment.  Nor was it meant to protect mere private opinion or thought.  It was intended to be just as concrete as the right of free speech, the right to be free from unreasonable searches, or any other enumerated right.  It is “held by the same tenure with all our other rights… it is enumerated with equal solemnity, or rather studied emphasis.” Id.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		III.  The general court understands the protections afforded to religious exercise under the New Hampshire Bill of Rights to be even stronger than those provided by the federal Bill of Rights.  New Hampshire Constitution, Part 1, Articles 5; 6.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		IV.  Governments have trampled on religious exercise by crafting generally applicable laws which do not explicitly target a religion or religious activity.  The fact that a law is generally applicable does not mean that it complies with the federal or state free exercise clauses.  As the United States Supreme Court has said, the “constitutional rights of those spreading their religious beliefs through the spoken and printed word are not to be gauged by standards governing retailers or wholesalers of books.” </span><span class="csE3E0FE0B">Murdock v. Com. of Pennsylvania</span><span class="csDD5E5F52">, 319 U.S. 105, 111 (1943).</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		V.  Protecting free exercise rights is especially important when it comes to the exercise of controversial or unpopular religious beliefs. “[M]any people hold beliefs alien to the majority of our society -- beliefs that are protected by the First Amendment but which could easily be trod upon under the guise of ‘police’ or ‘health’ regulations reflecting the majority's views.” </span><span class="csE3E0FE0B">Sherbert v. Verner</span><span class="csDD5E5F52">, 374 U.S. 398 at 411 (Douglas, J., concurring in the judgment).</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		VI.  The United States Supreme Court has observed that forcing people to abandon the precepts of their religion “puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine imposed” for a worship service. </span><span class="csE3E0FE0B">Sherbert</span><span class="csDD5E5F52">, 374 U.S. 398 at 404 (1963).</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		VII.  Although the state may legitimately burden religious exercise, it may only do so if there exists “some compelling state interest… [which] justifies the substantial infringement of [a person’s] First Amendment right.” Sherbert, 374 U.S. 398 at 406.  The government must have a “paramount interest” in burdening free exercise. Id.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		VIII.  In response to the common argument that religious liberty protections will result in confusion and anarchy, allowing individuals to capriciously nullify ordinary laws, the Supreme Court in 1963 found that “there is no proof whatever to warrant such fears of malingering or deceit… it is highly doubtful whether such evidence would be sufficient to warrant a substantial infringement of religious liberties.” </span><span class="csE3E0FE0B">Sherbert</span><span class="csDD5E5F52">, 374 U.S. 398 at 407.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		IX.  The free exercise of religion is currently under threat from many sides.  As four justices of the United States Supreme Court have observed, the Court’s 1990 decision in </span><span class="csE3E0FE0B">Employment Division v. Smith</span><span class="csDD5E5F52"> has “drastically cut back on the protection provided by the Free Exercise Clause.” </span><span class="csE3E0FE0B">Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist.</span><span class="csDD5E5F52">, cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 634, 635 (2019) (Alito, J., concurring.).  In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, many governors’ emergency orders have treated churches far more restrictively than comparable secular entities. </span><span class="csE3E0FE0B">Maryville Baptist Church, Inc. v. Beshear</span><span class="csDD5E5F52">, 957 F.3d 610, 614, (2020) (“The [Governor of Kentucky’s] orders also likely ‘prohibit[] the free exercise’ of ‘religion’ in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments… Discriminatory laws come in many forms.”). At the same time, federal politicians are currently introducing bills intended to roll back statutory protections for the free exercise of religion.  </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		X.  </span><span class="csE3E0FE0B">Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal</span><span class="csDD5E5F52">, 546 U.S. 418 (2006), indicates that legislative bodies may enact statutory law requiring that laws and other state action burdening the free exercise of religion be justified by a compelling governmental interest.  Many states have done so, passing laws similar to this act.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		XI.  The compelling interest test, set forth in pre-1990 Supreme Court rulings and this act, is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing governmental interests. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span><a name="Chapt3"></a><span class="csDD5E5F52">3  Purpose.
