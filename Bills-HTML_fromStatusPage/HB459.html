board, as well as budgets approved by county delegations or by the governing bodies of municipalities that do not require voter approval of budgets often contain general ledger line items containing an entry of zero dollars, whether determined by a budget committee, in a town deliberative session, a town meeting, or by a county delegation, it being the reasonable expectation of those authorized to grant final approval of budgets that while the governing bodies of the municipalities, counties, and school boards have discretion to transfer funds between general ledger line items, no such transfers are to be made to general ledger line items that contain an entry of zero dollars in the approved budgets.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		II.  Because the general ledger line items in the approved budgets are grouped and aggregated together for purposes of reporting the budgets to the department of revenue administration on its forms, the governing bodies of the municipalities, counties, and school boards are known to make transfers between general ledger line items into such general ledger line items containing entries of zero dollars as long as the transfers to not exceed the total budget allocation contained in the larger categories of budget categories in the department budget reporting forms.  This practice effectively contravenes the intent of the voters and, as applicable, the governing bodies, that approved the respective budgets with the expectation that an entry of zero dollars in a line item means that no money shall be transferred into such a line item in the approved budget.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt

of its duly adopted budget that contains an entry of zero dollars.  Such report shall be in the form of a detailed spreadsheet with full identifying information of any such general ledger line items,

No new general ledger line item shall be created after a budget has been finally approved unless it is due to an emergency or unforeseen circumstances and specifically approved at a special meeting called to create such new general ledger line item and to appropriate additional money to the budget.  Any moneys expended from a line item originally containing a zero dollar entry by reason of a transfer otherwise prohibited by this section shall revert to the general ledger line item from which the wrongful transfer had been made by transferring funds within the approved budget to offset said wrongful transfer from other general ledger line items having a positive dollar balance. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">	32:5-e  Procedure;
