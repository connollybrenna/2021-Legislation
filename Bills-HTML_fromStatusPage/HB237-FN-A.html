Services (DHHS) indicates the cost of consulting on the development of an informational handout and preparing a symbol for all cannabis advertising would be minimal, and assumes any printing and distribution costs would be covered by the Cannabis Control fund.  The DHHS estimates these costs may range between $10,000 and $25,000.  The DHHS assumes some of these costs may be covered by the funding provided for public marketing campaigns.  The amount of revenue available for DHHS prevention and treatment programs, and public marketing campaigns, is indeterminable.  The DHHS assumes the programs and campaigns would be contracted to qualified providers or agencies and it may become necessary hire additional staff to oversee these contracts, as current staff are already working at capacity to monitor the existing portfolio of contracts.   The DHHS notes the 2018 Final Report of the Commission to Study the Legalization, Regulation, and Taxation of Marijuana (Chapter 235, Laws of 2017), recommended that future legislation to legalize and commercialize marijuana should require funding of public education on safe use of marijuana as well as addiction and substance misuse treatment.  The Commission indicated a range of $4 to $5 million per year would be appropriate, and possibly more, depending upon the revenue generated from licensing and taxation.  The DHHS indicates the scope of education campaigns or expansion of any treatment capacity would be limited by the available funds and may not be adequate to promote public health and safety. </span></p><p

be done within the current budget.  The Attorney General’s Drug Task Force investigates street-level crimes that sometimes involve the sale and possession of controlled drugs, including marijuana.  If this bill were to pass, the task force’s efforts would be redirected away from marijuana cases to those involving other controlled drugs.  The Department does not anticipate savings to the task force would result from this bill.  The Department indicates the “Cannabis Control Commission” would be a state-level agency, similar to the Liquor Commission or Lottery Commission.  As such, the new commission would be a client agency of the Department’s Civil Bureau which would handle any litigation involving the new commission.  The Department anticipates that the new commission would result in increased requests for legal advice and representation.  Since this is a new agency, the Department of Justice cannot estimate the impact the new agency would have upon its staffing or financial needs, but expects those needs would increase.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Department of Safety indicates it

seized as evidence.  These costs are unknown.  There may also be savings as less cannabis would be submitted for analysis due to fewer arrests for cannabis possession.  The Department indicates fewer possession of cannabis cases may reduce local law enforcement expenditures, however any such reduction is speculative and cannot be estimated.  The number of certified Drug Recognition Experts (DREs) needed throughout the State may need to increase with additional  required roadside and/or after arrest evaluations of cannabis-impaired operators.  This potential cost is also unknown.  The Department suggests any savings from fewer arrests for cannabis possession could be offset by the unrelated charges that consistently accompany cannabis-related arrests such as DUI cases and associated analysis.  </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Judicial Branch indicates this bill, which makes it legal to possess personal-use quantities of marijuana, could reasonably be predicted to decrease the number of simple possession cases in the Circuit Courts, thus lessening the volume of cases and lowering revenues from fines.  However, the bill also creates a number of new violation-level offenses, which could reasonably be expected to lead to an increase in the volume of cases and increase revenues from fines.  In addition, if the bill becomes law, it is likely to increase the ubiquity and availability of marijuana, while at the same time making it illegal to consume marijuana in public.  This is likely to increase the number of violation-level offenses and the associated fine revenues.  Finally, the bill preserves the illegality of possessing marijuana in larger quantities and preserves the illegality of selling or exchanging marijuana outside of the permitted retail facilities.  This would likely have no effect on the number of misdemeanor and felony-level criminal cases brought in the Circuit and Superior Court or on the fine revenue from those proceedings.  The Branch assumes the bill would lead to an overall increase in the number of violation-level offenses in the Circuit Court and the fine revenue to the Alcohol Abuse Prevention and Treatment Fund.  The Branch expects the increase in workload could be absorbed within its existing resources.  </span></p><p

stand-alone marijuana possession charges.  Any violation level charges resulting from this bill will not impact indigent defense expenditures, as individuals are not entitled to court-appointed counsel for violations.  This bill is unlikely to reduce indigent defense expenditures because of the small number of stand-alone marijuana possession charges that implicate the right to counsel.  The Council indicates, due to the uncertainty of predicting the number of future cases the impact on indigent defense expenditures is indeterminable, but likely insignificant. </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Department of Corrections indicates the impact is indeterminable as it is not able to predict the number of people who would be impacted by the bill.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The New Hampshire Municipal Association indicates this bill would allow municipalities to restrict the number and type of cannabis establishments within their boundaries, as well as the time, manner, and place of operation of any cannabis facility.  Applications to operate cannabis establishments would be submitted to the Cannabis Control Commission and would also be subject to review by the host municipality.  The municipality would receive a $500 fee to review the application, except in the case of small cultivation facilities, for which the municipal fee would be $75.  As distribution of funds to municipalities depends on collections in the Cannabis Control Fund exceeding $100,000 plus the currently unknown administrative costs, and an as-of-yet-undetermined distribution formula, it is impossible to estimate the amount of any additional municipal revenues.  Legalization of cannabis is also likely to affect municipal expenditures, primarily for law enforcement.  There may be a reduction in expenditures related to drug enforcement because sale, possession, and use of cannabis by adults will no longer be illegal.  At the same time, if legalization results in an increase in usage, there may be an increase in expenditures related to impaired driving enforcement, overdose response, and preventing sale to minors.  These effects are speculative and not capable of estimate.  Therefore, the Association cannot estimate the effect on municipal expenditures.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The New Hampshire Association of Counties indicates it is not able to determine the number of individuals that this bill would impact, and therefore cannot determine the fiscal impact on county revenues and expenditures.</span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span></p><p class="cs9E885863"><span class="csDD5E5F52">The Department of Administrative Services assumes this bill would impact three of its divisions:</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
