care decisions that best reflect the person’s basic values; therefore, this chapter specifies that the directives of a person’s living will shall be superseded by the agent or surrogate provided that the agent or surrogate takes into full account all of the basic values of the person as articulated orally and/or in writing by the person, including in the living will.  In the event that no agent or
