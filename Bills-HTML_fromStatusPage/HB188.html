These qualities often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions.”  It has further found that “juveniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure…[Y]outh is more than a chronological fact.  It is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.  This is explained in part by the prevailing circumstance that juveniles have less control, or less experience with control, over their own environment.”</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		II.  Children need access to counsel when they come in contact with the juvenile justice system.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		III.  The role of the juvenile defender is complex and reflects the unique status of childhood in terms of immaturity, disability, and trauma.  The juvenile defender must be knowledgeable as to legal jurisprudence relating to the representation of children, including child development, capacity to participate in legal proceedings, methods and effectiveness and availability of treatment and dispositional alternatives.</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		IV.  Juvenile defenders play a critical role in the fair administration of justice for children, including both legal and extralegal processes. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		V.  Counsel must receive appropriate training in juvenile justice law and statutes; services for children; communication with children in a developmentally appropriate and effective manner; effective interviewing techniques involving children and to recognize how trauma, disability and immaturity affect the behavior and relationships of young people. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		VI.  Effective representation of youth requires consultation and advocacy at the earliest stage possible and until the child is no longer subject to the juvenile justice system. </span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52">		VII.  The courts have long noted that young persons are more susceptible to police coercion and in more need of counsel when facing police questioning.  Special protection is particularly necessary in the context of affording young persons their Miranda rights, as they are less capable of comprehending such warnings than adults.  The Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that the age of the suspect can determine whether a person is in custody for purposes of Miranda.  "It is beyond dispute that children will often feel bound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the same circumstances would feel free to leave.”</span></p><p class="csF0A1D375" style="tab-stops:left 18pt left 36pt left 54pt left 72pt left 90pt;"><span class="csDD5E5F52"> </span><a name="Chapt2"></a><span class="csDD5E5F52">2  Delinquent Children;
